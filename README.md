This repository is a personal collection of small Roblox scripts and systems I’ve built while learning, testing ideas, and exploring how Roblox games behave when you add custom tooling on the client side.

The focus of this repo is on practical in-game tools — things that make testing faster, debugging easier, and experimentation more interesting.

How to use:

Copy a script from one of the folders.

Read the README inside that folder for any notes or settings.

Place the script inside your executor

Run it in your executor you should see a small gui pop up.
